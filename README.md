### DATA CLEANING / TRANSFORMATION
The CSV file was imported into Power BI for the analysis. Here are what was done to the raw data step by step.
-	I promoted the second row to become the header, then changed the data type for of the index columns to text since I do not need the number for analysis.
-	I had to filter out empty rows, then created conditional columns to devices by price, rating review.
